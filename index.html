        I'm a technical researcher in the Mechanical Engineering Research Institute,
        <strong>Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)</strong>, advised by Prof. Seung-Woo Kim & Prof. Young-Jin Kim.

      <h3>Advanced diffraction imaging </h3>
      <p class="bodytext">
        We demonstrated extreme-ultraviolet(EUV) light source with high photon flux based on lensless focusing scheme as described below.
        Since EUV beam can be tightly focused onto an imaging sample,
        far-field diffraction pattern with enough signal noise ratio might be provided, and therefore, give alternative way to acheive diffraction-based imaging.
        We are trying to devise a new advanced diffraction imaging system that can utilize the advantages of our EUV light source,
        compared to other diffraction imaging techniques and light sources.

      <h3>EUV beam control</h3>
      <p class="bodytext">
      Although EUV radiation has been a growing research field of interest due to its wavelength-scale high resolution,
      EUV light displays high absorption rate in almost all existing material, requiring an usage of unique reflective multilayered optics and hindering its applications in itself.
      Our mission is to demonstrate robust EUV beam control method, e.g. EUV beam scanning and focusing without any help of EUV optics.
      Based on noncollinear high harmonic generation scheme and a solid sample, the new table-top EUV light source was successfully developed.
      It exhibited robust controllability of EUV beam propagation via wavefront modulation of the driving laser beams.
      In addition, by spatio-temporally overlapping two driving annular beams with different converging angle at the sample, tight focusing of EUV annular beam as a form of bessel beam can also demonstrated (~400 nm focal spot).
      We are preparing for submission to journal.

      <h3>EUV spectral control & optimization </h3>
      <p class="bodytext">
      High harmonic generation is high nonlinear frequency upconversion process that requires intense ultrafast laser.
      Therefore, any kind of degradation in drving laser intensity should be carefully considered.
      By compensating for the phenomenon contributing to the decrease in its intensity, so called propagation effect, further amplification of the EUV yield can be acheived.
      Our results showed not only exceptional increase of overal harmonic yield, but also selective amplification for certain harmonic in solid sample.
      This research exhibits potential for internal electron dynamics analysis and attosecond science.
      Our journal is now under review.

      <h3>Tunable droplet generation </h3>
      <p class="bodytext">
        We demonstrated a mechanically and directionally tunable elestic device that enable to actively control droplet breakup.
        In microfluidics, step emulsification has been attracting much attention; because it can easily scaleup the droplet formation based on its insensitivity to flow fluctuation.
        However, since its droplet formation is fully geometry-dependent, active control for its size cannot be simlply achieved by flow control.
        We envisioned a droplet generating stystem dealing with both mass production and size cotrollability,
        via soft materials allowing its nozzles' shrinkage and expansion.
        Applying tensile stress on the device, we changed the nozzles' geometry and accordingly tuned some degree of the droplet size.
        We are preparing for submission to journal. <br>

      <h3>Electrostatic Gripper for flexible material  </h3>
      <p class="bodytext">
        My bachelor thesis was to develop an electrostatic force-driven gripper with a structure of beam-array,
        offering sophisticated solution for gripping flexible materials.
        Due to its high applicability to targets with various size and arbitrary surface profile,
        the possiblity of being alternative way to grip soft mater had been widely explored and investigated.
        However, it was also known that precise arrangement of multilayer electrodes demands high precision of manufacturing
        and limits its performance.
        We demonstrated simple alternate wet & dry etching process via a single photo-mask,
        which enable to process the multilayer thin films in the exactly same shape.
        The developed dipolar-electrostatic gripper was free from alignment problems and as a result, it displayed improved performance in terms of adhesive force.
        The study was published in 2018.
