See below.</p> <hr> <p>Atmospheric turbulence is one of the main obstacles in ground-based optical imaging, as it rapidly distorts incoming wavefronts and degrades image resolution. Recovering diffraction-limited information under such conditions remains a challenging problem, especially in low-photon regimes. To test our turbulence-aware computational imaging approach under real observing conditions, I visited the McDonald Observatory for on-sky imaging demonstrations. The goal was to evaluate how our reconstruction algorithms perform beyond simulations and laboratory experiments.</p> <p>During the observations, we imaged binary star systems and several other astronomical targets. Seeing these objects resolved on-sky using our own methods was both exciting and rewarding.</p> <p>It was eye-opening to see how fast and strong the atmospheric turbulence can be in practice. Its impact was more severe than I had expected, and experiencing it firsthand provided intuition that simulations alone cannot fully capture. This experience will directly inform future algorithm development and system modeling.</p> <p>Overall, the trip was a valuable step toward bridging theory, computation, and real on-sky imaging.</p> <h4 id="hipster-list">Hipster list</h4> <ul> <li>brunch</li> <li>fixie</li> <li>raybans</li> <li>messenger bag</li> </ul> <p>Hoodie Thundercats retro, tote bag 8-bit Godard craft beer gastropub.
