Atmospheric turbulence is one of the biggest challenges in ground-based optical imaging.
It rapidly distorts incoming wavefronts and degrades image resolution, making it difficult
to recover diffraction-limited scenes—especially under photon-limited conditions.

To evaluate how our turbulence-aware computational imaging approach performs in the real world,
we visited the McDonald Observatory for on-sky imaging demonstrations (Nov. 27–Dec. 4, 2025).
This trip provided an opportunity to move beyond simulations and laboratory experiments and
test our reconstruction algorithms under actual observing conditions.

During the observations, we imaged binary star systems along with several other astronomical targets.
Watching these objects emerge from noisy, turbulence-distorted measurements using our own methods
was both exciting and deeply rewarding.

What struck me most was just how fast and strong the atmospheric turbulence can be in practice.
Its impact was more severe—and far more dynamic—than I had anticipated.
