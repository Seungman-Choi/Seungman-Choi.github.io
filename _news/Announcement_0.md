Atmospheric turbulence is one of the main obstacles in ground-based optical imaging, as it rapidly distorts incoming wavefronts and degrades image resolution. Recovering diffraction-limited information under such conditions remains a challenging problem, especially in low-photon regimes.
To test our turbulence-aware computational imaging approach under real observing conditions, I visited the McDonald Observatory for on-sky imaging demonstrations. The goal was to evaluate how our reconstruction algorithms perform beyond simulations and laboratory experiments.

During the observations, we imaged binary star systems and several other astronomical targets. Seeing these objects resolved on-sky using our own methods was both exciting and rewarding.

It was eye-opening to see how fast and strong the atmospheric turbulence can be in practice. Its impact was more severe than I had expected, and experiencing it firsthand provided intuition that simulations alone cannot fully capture. This experience will directly inform future algorithm development and system modeling.

Overall, the trip was a valuable step toward bridging theory, computation, and real on-sky imaging.
