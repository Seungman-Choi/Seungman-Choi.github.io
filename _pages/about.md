I'm a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University,
advised by [Prof. Zubin Jacob](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8FXvN_EAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (2022–present).
My research focuses on physics-informed computational imaging under photon-limited regimes.
By bridging optical system design, estimation theory, and information-theoretic analysis, 
my work aims to push imaging performance beyond conventional resolution limits, with a focus on challenging problems in astronomical and semiconductor imaging.

My early training was in mechanical engineering, where I received both my B.S. and M.S. degrees from Tokyo Institute of Technology.
I then worked as a research associate at KAIST while fulfilling my military service, under the supervision of [Prof. Seung-Woo Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wHt0GtQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Prof. Young-Jin Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DqkYhz4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
During this period, I gained extensive hands-on experience in EUV beam and pulse shaping, as well as coherent diffraction imaging, which laid the foundation for my current research.
