<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I’m a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8FXvN_EAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Zubin Jacob</a> (2022–present). My research focuses on physics-informed computational imaging under photon-limited regimes. By bridging optical system design, estimation theory, and information-theoretic analysis, my work aims to push imaging performance beyond conventional resolution limits, with a focus on challenging problems in astronomical and semiconductor imaging.</p> <p>My early training was in mechanical engineering, where I received both my B.S. and M.S. degrees from Tokyo Institute of Technology. I then worked as a research associate at KAIST while fulfilling my military service, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wHt0GtQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Seung-Woo Kim</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DqkYhz4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Young-Jin Kim</a>. During this period, I gained extensive hands-on experience in EUV beam and pulse shaping, as well as coherent diffraction imaging, which laid the foundation for my current research.</p> </body></html>
